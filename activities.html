We know you’ll be hungry from dancing at prom, and we as your benevolent officers have put together an amazing menu and have ordered enough to satisfy any food connoisseur’s appetite. The venue will be catering <span id="gold">hors d'oeuvres</span> (light snacks - don’t worry, we can’t say it either) throughout the night.</p>

Join us early on at the venue to watch the <span id="gold">sunset</span> in an array of golden colors. Once the night comes, we’ll have a <span id="gold">gorgeous pathway of lights</span> to walk through and experience, either with friends, a date, or introspectively by yourself.
