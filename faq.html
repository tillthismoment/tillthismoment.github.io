                    <h1>Am I allowed to drive to the Venue?</h1>
                    <p>YES. We got confirmation from administration that you are allowed to drive to the venue - assuming that you are legally allowed to drive.</p>

                <div id="question">
                    <h1>Are guests required to bring the permission + medical forms?</h1>
                    <p>YES. If they get injured at the event we'll need to know how to proceed forward for medical attention. Have them photo copy their driver's license if you can't bring the physical version.</p>

                <div id="question">
                    <h1>Why do bids cost SO MUCH MONEY??</h1>
                    <p>We understand that $50 may seem like a lot of money to pay for a dance, but the entire cost of the bids are put into making various aspects of the nights, such as the food, DJ, fun activities, etc. perfect for you! In comparison to other proms, our tickets are much cheaper than schools that price their tickets at $60 and above.</p>

                    <h1>How do I get to the venue?</h1>
                    <p>The best way to get to the venue would be by driving there! It is located right off of Highway US-101 S.

                    <h1>If I don’t have any suits or tuxedos, what do I do?
</h1>
                    <p>Have no fear, Tuxedo Warehouse is here!! In our area there are many places where you can get measured and rent a suit or tuxedo. During our Junior Prom Fashion Show, on February 26th we will have Tuxedo Warehouse (located in the Westgate Mall) come over and give measurements to those who need it. They are also offering a 15% discount to Lynbrook students on tuxedo/suit rentals, so be sure to take advantage of this opportunity!</p>

</h1>
                    <p>We will be offering top of the line hors d'oeuvres for you to eat. “Hors d’oeuvres” is fancy French term for small exquisite snacks, so expect to eat dinner with your pre-prom group before coming to the event. We will also be offering a variety of small desserts.</p>

                    <h1>Who is the DJ?</h1>

                    <p>If you must leave early or come late, please let the Administration know ahead of time. You’ll miss out on a lot of fun though!</p>

                    <h1>What can I do if I start feeling hot in my jacket?
</h1>
                    <p>We understand that all of you are hot and will need to remove your jackets sometime during the event. At the venue we have some awesome volunteers who will be running a coat check booth, where you can drop off your jackets and/or high heels!</p>

            <div id="question">
                    <h1>Do I need a date?
</h1>
                    <p>Absolutely not! (<s>Trust us, Harsh might not even have a date!</s>) We want Junior Prom to be an open and fun environment, rather than a date-based and formal one! We encourage you to come with your friends for a night to remember. We want you to live, laugh, smile, play, and dance Until the End, whether it’s with a date or not!

                    <h1>This dance seems pretty far away from Lynbrook… will it be safe?
</h1>
                    <p>This dance will be one of the safest dances you can attend! We are lucky enough to have multiple staff members coming to chaperone the event. The presence of certified CIA agent Mr. Ramirez alone should make you feel safe, but we will also have multiple security guards/police officers supervising the event.</p>
