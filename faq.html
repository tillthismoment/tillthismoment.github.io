                    <h1>What are we going to be doing at Prom?</h1>
                    <p>Prom is a once in a lifetime experience that will consist of an amazing dance on a boat, at the San Francisco pier. Plan on eating a yummy dinner, turning up with your homies, and dancing your hearts out! There will also be a photo booth to take pictures!</p>

                    <h1>What do we do when we arrive to Lynbrook on prom day?
</h1>
                    <p>When you arrive, you will have a chance to get your prom photo’s taken by Pro Image, if you purchased a photo package. The photos will be taken in the Gym! Make sure to purchase your photo packages ahead of time so that you can skip the wait in line :) Other than that they’ll be a bunch of snacks and music! It’s a great time to get pumped and excited to get to prom!!

                    <h1>How are we getting to SF?</h1>
                    <p>The only way that you can enter the boat at Senior Prom is by going with the busses that you will have signed up for on the Bus Form. If you’re not signed up for a bus, message a Class Officer, because that’s the only way that you’ll be allowed on the boat!</p>

</h1>
                    <p>This dance will be one of the safest dances you can attend! We are lucky enough to have multiple staff members coming to chaperone the event. The presence of certified CIA agent Mr. Ramirez alone should make you feel safe, but we will also have multiple security guards/police officers supervising the event.</p>
